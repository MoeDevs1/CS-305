## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

The financial consulting firm Artemis Financial aimed to enhance software security and modernize its operations. In order to guarantee secure data transfers—particularly when handling sensitive financial information—they had to incorporate a file verification step into their online application. This is similar to a bank updating its security protocols to protect client information and transactions. Like a bank, Artemis Financial recognized the need of upholding confidence and safeguarding client information.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? 

I found a number of problems throughout the vulnerability evaluation, such as unsafe data transfer, inadequate input validation, weak authentication, and careless error handling. Similar to holes in a bank's security system, these vulnerabilities have the potential to allow unauthorized access and data breaches if they are taken advantage of. Coding securely is vital because it prevents incidents like major banking organizations experiencing data breaches and losing customer trust, as well as the potential legal and financial consequences. Secure software adds value to a company by safeguarding sensitive data, maintaining customer trust, and preventing costly security incidents, much like a bank's security measures add to its overall wellbeing.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was strengthening input validation. This is akin to implementing rigorous security measures, similar to advanced fraud detection systems, to protect against potential attacks. It was challenging because it required a deep understanding of possible attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 

SSL significantly contributed to increased security by protecting our data and guaranteeing that private information was kept private and secure both during transmission and storage. Additionally, I made sure that our application's security measures included robust input validation, dependable authentication and authorization, and more effective error handling. Looking ahead, I would continue to use automated tools to scan for security weaknesses and perform penetration testing to identify and fix any vulnerabilities before they could be exploited. This approach is like regularly updating and reinforcing the security measures, much like a bank would, to maintain trust and protect customer information.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured code and the software application were functional and secure by conducting rigorous testing, followed by penetration testing. Penetration testing is similar to performing security drills to identify any potential weaknesses introduced during the code refactoring process. Just like a bank routinely checks its security measures to ensure they are effective, this process ensured that the code remained secure, and no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 

I made use of tools like security libraries, secure coding techniques, and OWASP guidelines. These are similar to fundamental instruments and procedures that can be applied to other assignments or tasks to improve software security, much like a bank's security procedures.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 

I can show my effective mitigation strategy and my capacity to recognize and fix security flaws in software applications with this assignment. I can liken it to how a bank consistently enhances its security protocols to guarantee a high degree of trust and protection for client information. For prospective employers, this would be an invaluable testimonial to my abilities, expertise, and experience.
